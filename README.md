Usage
=====

To install Image Slideshow as an experimental Chrome extension:
 * Select Extensions from the Chrome "Tools" menu.
 * Click the "Developer Mode" checkbox to open developer options.
 * Click "Load unpacked extension..." Navigate to the root of the extension
   directory  (the location where manifest.json lives) and select that
   directory.
 * The extension will add an icon to your navigation bar. To start a slideshow,
   click the icon to configure your settings (select username and albums to
   show), then click "Display Slideshow" to begin.

Future Development
==================

 * Support for other image APIs (Flickr, Shutterfly, Specific URLs)
 * Proper scaling of images with aspect ratios different from the window aspect
   ratio.
